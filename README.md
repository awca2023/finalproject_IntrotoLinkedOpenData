# finalproject_IntrotoLinkedOpenData

## This repo is Agnes' week 4 submission for the GitHub course. 

### How did GitHub support this project?

GitHub is useful in this project because it allows me to organize my notes for my lesson. If this final project was used in a school setting, I can collaborate with a classmate and use GitHub for our notes. We can either branch off the repo or take on different aspects of the lesson and write our notes. This way the repo would be the singular place to store all of our notes and we can know who wrote what (which can be useful for clarifications).

Moreover, if I ever write a paper about this lesson, GitHub would be a great place to track my changes for a paper and allow me to spin off my drafts if I ever need to do so (leveraging the branch feature).

If I had more time and had more HTML skills, I would have like to link all my note pages in the Index page so that there's a place to directly link to my notes. Another idea I had would be to create another minibookdown and publish my notes like a textbook.
